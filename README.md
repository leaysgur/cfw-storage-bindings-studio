# cfw-storage-bindings-studio

Generic GUI for storage-related bindings based on `cfw-wrangler-bindings-bridge` module.

You can interact both local and remote data!

## What does it solve?

- Remotely: Cloudflare dashboard is not a good UX(sorry, IMO)
- Locally: `miniflare` persistent source, no way to easily see what's in it

This module tries to solve these both problems at once.
