# cfw-storage-bindings-studio

> ðŸš§ Work in progress... ðŸ‘·

Generic GUI for storage-related bindings based on [`cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge`](https://github.com/leaysgur/cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge) module.

You can interact both local and remote data! ðŸ§™

## What does it solve?

- Remotely: Cloudflare dashboard required auth, and not a good UX(sorry, IMO)
- Locally: `miniflare` persistent source, no way to easily see what's in it

This module tries to solve these both problems at once.

## Usage

```sh
npx cfw-storage-bindings-studio

# Options
# For GUI running port, default: 3000
npx cfw-storage-bindings-studio --studio-port 5173
# For bridge worker settings
npx cfw-storage-bindings-studio --config ./path/to/wrangler.toml --remote
npx cfw-storage-bindings-studio --config ./path/to/wrangler.toml --persist-to ./path/to/.wrangler/state
```
